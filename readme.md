if something has important enough you have to do it if it hard and take time or anything else. 

its nothing to do with motivation or anything you have to do it by . get up and do it.


Hello World, Vinayak Here.
I am a Data Scientist and a Curious Human & Lifelong Learner.
I love the science of using Data to gather insights, solve problems and make human lives convenient!
Learning about the science of computing, data, simulations fascinates me.
I also like to share my learnings and knowledge through blog posts to facilitate an easy welcome to newcomers so they don't have to face the problems I went through when building new things.
Besides these, I love anime, mythology & spirituality.
